## The Root: *Comprendre*

The root verb for "to understand" is **comprendre**. It is irregular, but it follows the same pattern as *prendre* (to take), *apprendre* (to learn), and *surprendre* (to surprise).

### Simple Present Table (Présent)

| Subject | Conjugation | English |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Je** | *comprends* | I understand |
| **Tu** | *comprends* | You understand (informal) |
| **Il / Elle / On** | *comprend* | He / She / One understands |
| **Nous** | *comprenons* | We understand |
| **Vous** | *comprenez* | You understand (formal) |
| **Ils / Elles** | *comprennent* | They understand |

> **Pro Tip:** For the first three, the "s" and "d" are silent. For *Ils comprennent*, we double the 'n' and pronounce it clearly: *com-prenn*.

## The "Besarme" Concept: "Can you...?"

In Spanish, you use **enclisis** (attaching to the end): *¿Puedes ayudar**me**?*. In French, the pronoun **must** jump in front of the infinitive.

We use the verb **pouvoir** (to be able to/can):

* **Je peux** (I can)
* **Tu peux** (You can)
* **Il peut** (He can)
* **Nous pouvons** (We can)
* **Vous pouvez** (You can - formal)
* **Ils peuvent** (They can)

### Comparison: Spanish vs. French

| English | Spanish (End-loaded) | French (Front-loaded) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Can you help me?** | *¿Puedes ayudarme?* | *Peux-tu **m'**aider ?* |
| **Can you kiss me?** | *¿Puedes besarme?* | *Peux-tu **m'**embrasser ?* |
| **I want to understand it.** | *Quiero comprenderlo.* | *Je veux **le** comprendre.* |

## Quick Summary for your Brain

In French, the object pronoun (*me, te, le, la, nous, vous, les*) almost always sits **between** the conjugated verb (*peux*) and the infinitive (*aider*).

**Tu as compris ?** (Did you understand?) Try translating this for me: *"I can help you"* (using the informal *tu*). Remember to move that pronoun to the front of the action!
