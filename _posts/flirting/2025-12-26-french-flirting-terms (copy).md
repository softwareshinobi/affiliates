What is the root verb for understand in French


And give me the table for simple present

The root verb for "to understand" in French is comprendre.

It is an irregular verb, though it follows the same conjugation pattern as the verb prendre (to take).
Conjugation: Present Indicative (Présent)

Here is the table for comprendre in the simple present tense:
Pronoun	Conjugation	English Translation
Je	comprends	I understand
Tu	comprends	You understand (informal)
Il / Elle / On	comprend	He / She / One understands
Nous	comprenons	We understand
Vous	comprenez	You understand (formal/plural)
Ils / Elles	comprennent	They understand
A Few Quick Tips:

    Pronunciation: For je, tu, and il/elle, the final "s" or "d" is silent. It sounds like "com-prahn."

    The Double 'N': Notice that in the ils/elles (plural) form, the "n" doubles: comprennent.

    Related Verbs: Because this follows the pattern of prendre, you now also know how to conjugate apprendre (to learn) and surprendre (to surprise)!

Would you like me to create some practice sentences using these forms to help you memorize them?

So those conjugate the same bit are irregular?


And how to use


Can you help me

Can you kiss me


Similar to the besarme concept

Yes, exactly! They are "irregular" because they don't follow the standard pattern for regular -re verbs (like vendre), but they are consistent within their own family.

If you can conjugate prendre, you can conjugate any verb that ends in -prendre.
"Can you..." and the "Besarme" Concept

In Spanish, "besarme" (kiss me) attaches the pronoun to the end of the infinitive. French is slightly different. While French also uses a "Helper Verb + Infinitive" structure, the pronoun usually sits between the two verbs.

To say "Can you...", we use the verb pouvoir (to be able to).
1. Can you help me?

    Peux-tu m'aider ? (Informal) Pouvez-vous m'aider ? (Formal)

    Peux/Pouvez: The conjugated form of "can."

    m' (me): The pronoun.

    aider: The root verb (to help).

2. Can you kiss me?

    Peux-tu m'embrasser ? (Informal) Pouvez-vous m'embrasser ? (Formal)

    m' (me): This is the "me" from "besarme." In French, it comes before the action word (embrasser).

Comparison: Spanish vs. French
English	Spanish (Enclitic)	French Structure
Can you help me?	¿Puedes ayudarme?	Peux-tu **m'**aider ?
Can you kiss me?	¿Puedes besarme?	Peux-tu **m'**embrasser ?
I want to understand it.	Quiero comprenderlo.	Je veux le comprendre.

Key Rule: In French, the object pronoun (me, te, le, la, nous, vous, les) almost always jumps in front of the verb it belongs to.
Quick Conjugation of "Pouvoir" (To be able to / Can)

Since you'll use this for all "Can you..." questions, here is the shorthand:

    Je peux (I can)

    Tu peux (You can)

    Il/Elle peut (He/She can)

    Nous pouvons (We can)

    Vous pouvez (You can - formal)

    Ils/Elles peuvent (They can)

Would you like to try translating a sentence like "Can you understand me?" to see if you've got the word order down?
