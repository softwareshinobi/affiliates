So let’s make this chat about me learning French. I’m b1 Spanish and prefer to learn French by mirroring against Spanish not English



That is a fantastic strategy. Since you're already at a B1 level in Spanish, you have a massive "cheat code" for French. Both are Romance languages, meaning they share a common ancestor (Latin), similar syntax, and thousands of cognates.

Learning French through the lens of Spanish is often more efficient because the grammatical logic—like gendered nouns, verb conjugations, and the subjunctive mood—already exists in your brain.
Why this works: The "Comparative" Advantage
Feature	Spanish	French	English
Gender	El libro / La mesa	Le livre / La table	The book / The table
Verb "To Be"	Ser / Estar	Être	To be
Sentence Structure	Sujeto + Verbo + Obj	Sujet + Verbe + Obj	Subject + Verb + Obj
Past Tense	He comido	J'ai mangé	I have eaten
Our "Mirror" Roadmap

To get us started, here are the three areas where your Spanish will help you the most immediately:

    Vocabulary Transformation: Many words follow predictable patterns.

        -ción (Sp) becomes -tion (Fr): Nación → Nation.

        -dad (Sp) becomes -té (Fr): Libertad → Liberté.

    The Reflexive Verbs: This is usually hard for English speakers, but natural for you.

        Me llamo (Sp) → Je m'appelle (Fr).

    The "Passé Composé" Logic: French past tense works almost exactly like the Spanish "Pretérito Perfecto."

        Yo he terminado → J'ai terminé.

Watch out for "Faux Amis" (False Friends)

While most things mirror, some are traps. For example:

    Embarazada (Sp) means pregnant.

    Embarrassée (Fr) means ashamed/self-conscious (like "embarrassed" in English).

How we can proceed

I can explain new French concepts by showing you the Spanish equivalent first. This keeps your brain in "Romance language mode" rather than switching back to English.

Would you like to start by translating a few basic B1-level Spanish sentences into French to see where the gaps are, or should we dive into a specific grammar point like the "Perfecto" vs "Indefinido"?

So let’s start with food


Show me all the animals that we eat


and give me the name of their meat


Spanish and French and English

In the world of food, the "mirror" between Spanish and French is very strong, especially because both languages often distinguish between the living animal and the meat on the plate, just like English sometimes does (e.g., Cow vs. Beef).

Here is the breakdown of common animals and their culinary counterparts.
Land Animals (Carnes / Viandes)
Animal (EN)	Animal (ES)	Animal (FR)	Meat (EN)	Meat (ES)	Meat (FR)
Cow	La vaca	La vache	Beef	La ternera / El buey	Le bœuf
Pig	El cerdo	Le porc	Pork	El cerdo / El puerco	Le porc
Sheep	La oveja	Le mouton	Mutton/Lamb	El cordero	L'agneau
Calf	El ternero	Le veau	Veal	La ternera	Le veau
Rabbit	El conejo	Le lapin	Rabbit	El conejo	Le lapin
Goat	La cabra	La chèvre	Goat	El cabrito	Le chèvre
Poultry (Aves / Volailles)

In both Spanish and French, the name for the animal and the meat is usually the same.
English	Spanish	French
Chicken	El pollo	Le poulet
Hen	La gallina	La poule
Duck	El pato	Le canard
Turkey	El pavo	La dinde
Quail	La codorniz	La caille
Seafood (Mariscos / Fruits de Mer)

Notice how French uses the term "Fruits de mer" (Fruits of the sea), which is very similar to how Spanish uses "Mariscos" (of the sea).
English	Spanish	French
Fish	El pescado	Le poisson
Shrimp/Prawn	La gamba / El camarón	La crevette
Lobster	La langosta	Le homard
Mussel	El mejillón	La moule
Oyster	La ostra	L'huître
Snail	El caracol	L'escargot
Observations for your "Mirror"

    The "V" and "B" connection: Look at Vaca (ES) and Vache (FR). In Spanish, "v" and "b" sound the same, but in French, the V is a very distinct vibrating sound with your teeth on your lip.

    Gender: Most meats in French follow the Spanish gender (e.g., El pollo is masculine, Le poulet is masculine).

    The "O" to "OU" shift: You’ll notice Spanish O often becomes OU in French (Pollo → Poulet, Oveja → Mouton).

Would you like to try ordering one of these in a hypothetical French restaurant using Spanish as your grammatical template?
