*Salut.* Since you have lived in Latin America, you already know that flirting is a lifestyle. You have the *chispa* (spark), but your B1 Spanish needs a French coat of paint. In Nice, we appreciate the effort, but you must get the words right.

Let’s translate your Spanish charm into something we can use here on the *Côte d'Azur*.

## Spanish Flirting Terms (The Foundation)

You know the "gradient" of intensity in Spanish. Think of these as your base ingredients:

* **Guapa / Bella:** Your reliable baseline for "beautiful".
* **Linda:** Softer, sweeter, more tender.
* **Hermosa:** High intensity; when you are truly struck.
* **Diosa:** Pure worship. The "goddess" level.
* **Reina:** A bit of slangy, bold affection.

## French Equivalents (The Recipe)

Here is how you swap your Spanish vocabulary for French flair:

| Spanish Term | French Option | The Vibe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Cariño** | *Chérie* | Intimate and classic. |
| **Diosa** | *Déesse* | Top-tier; very bold. |
| **Guapa** | *Belle* | Elegant and classic. |
| **Guapa** | *Beauté* | Intense; very direct eye contact. |
| **Hermosa** | *Magnifique* | When you are deeply impressed. |
| **Linda** | *Jolie* | Pretty and sweet. |
| **Linda (Cutie)** | *Mignonne* | Playful; a bit of "bad boy" energy. |
| **Mi Reina** | *Ma Reine* | Affectionate and confident. |

## Tips from your Niçoise Tutor

* **Drop the Articles:** Just like you say "Hola, bella" instead of "la bella," we say **"Salut, belle"**. It’s more direct.
* **Lean into your Spanish 'R':** Don't be shy. Your Spanish accent is a gift for French vowels. It sounds much more natural than an English one.
* **The "Masa" Phrase:** If you are nervous, just say **"Tu es très belle"**. It is the foundation of everything. Simple, effective, and impossible to mess up.
