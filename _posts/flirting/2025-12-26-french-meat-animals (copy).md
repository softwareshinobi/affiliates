If you are a B1 Spanish speaker, you are already ahead of the game. You understand the gender of nouns and the rhythm of a Romance language. However, there is a specific hurdle: the placement of pronouns.

In Spanish, you’re used to the flexibility of **enclisis**—sticking pronouns to the end of infinitives. In French, we are more "front-loaded."

## The Pronoun Migration: Front vs. Back

In French, the pronoun must "migrate" to the position immediately before the verb it modifies. You cannot attach it to the end of an infinitive like you do in Spanish.

| English | Spanish (Attached) | French Equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| You can understand **me**. | Puedes entender**me**. | Tu peux **m'**entendre. |
| I want to see **it**. | Quiero ver**lo**. | Je veux **le** voir. |
| He should tell **us**. | Él debe decir**nos**. | Il doit **nous** dire. |

### The "Command" Exception

The only time French feels like Spanish is the **Imperative** (commands).

* **Spanish:** *¡Dime!*
* **French:** *Dis-moi !*

But be careful! If the command is negative, the pronoun jumps back to the front: *Ne **me** dis pas !* (Don't tell me).

## The Root Verb: *Comprendre* (To Understand)

To master pronoun placement, you need a strong verb. **Comprendre** is perfect because it functions like the Spanish *comprender*. It is an irregular verb, but it shares its DNA with *prendre* (to take) and *apprendre* (to learn).

### Conjugation Table: Present Tense

| Subject | French | Spanish Equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Je** | *comprends* | Yo comprendo |
| **Tu** | *comprends* | Tú comprendes |
| **Il / Elle / On** | *comprend* | Él / Ella comprende |
| **Nous** | *comprenons* | Nosotros comprendemos |
| **Vous** | *comprenez* | Usted(es) comprende(n) |
| **Ils / Elles** | *comprennent* | Ellos / Ellas comprenden |

> **Teacher's Note:** For the plural *Ils comprennent*, ignore the "-ent" at the end. Just pronounce the "n" clearly. It should sound like *com-prenn*.

## Putting it Together: Spanish vs. French

As a Spanish speaker, your brain is wired to look for the object at the end of the action. In French, you have to **anticipate** the object before you even hit the verb.

* **Spanish:** *Ellos me comprenden.* (Same order!) → **French:** *Ils me comprennent.*
* **Spanish:** *Queremos entenderte.* (End-loaded) → **French:** *Nous voulons t'entendre.* (Front-loaded)

**Would you like to try translating a few "I want to [verb] you" sentences to see if you can catch the pronoun placement?**
