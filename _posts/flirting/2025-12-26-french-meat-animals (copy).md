Bonjour, comment ça va ?

Bonjour ! Ça va très bien, merci. Et vous ?

Ça va très bien. Merci.

Je suis contente de l'apprendre ! Tu as des plans pour aujourd'hui ?

Son

    Connecting...

Je vois ! Rien de spécial à l'horizon donc ?

Computer orders, don't say in French, are you done?

Ah, d'accord ! Tu préfères parler en anglais ? Pas de problème ! What's up? Anything exciting planned for today?

So, first, let's review what I what we both said, what I said, what I was trying to say, and then what's the correct way to say it in French.

Sure! You started by saying "Bonjour, comment ça va?", which is correct and means "Hello, how are you?". I responded with "Bonjour! Ça va très bien, merci. Et vous?", which is also correct, meaning "Hello! I'm very well, thank you. And you?". Then you said "Ça va très bien, merci", which is perfect. Was there a specific part you wanted to practice or clarify?

I called you Jolie or thought I did. Did you catch that? And what does Jolie mean? And why would I call you Jolie?

Ah yes, you did! "Jolie" in French means "pretty" or "nice". Perhaps you meant to say that as a compliment?

Yeah, I'm trying to work on my flirting.

I understand! French can be quite poetic. Is there a particular phrase you'd like to learn or practice?

Well, no. So right now I want to talk about uh sentence verb structure concept. So stay with me here. So I am B1 in Spanish, but I'm a native English speaker. And in Spanish, for example, you could say, "Puedes entenderme," which is, "Can you hear me?" So you can take the verb and stick to the end of it, me, te, le, etc. What is that called in in Spanish? And does French have the equivalent? And if so, give me an example.

That construction is called enclisis in Spanish, where the pronoun is attached to the verb. French doesn't typically have that same structure. Instead, pronouns usually come before the verb. For example, to say "Can you understand me?", you would say "Peux-tu m'entendre?" or "Est-ce que tu peux m'entendre?". The pronoun "me" becomes "m'" and goes before the verb.

So they do have it but it’s in the front not the back?

Exactly. You’ve hit on one of the biggest "brain-switching" hurdles for English and Spanish speakers learning French.

In Spanish, you have the flexibility to attach the pronoun to the end of an infinitive (enclitic), but in French, the pronoun almost always "migrates" to the front of the verb it belongs to (proclitic).

Here is the breakdown of how that looks and what it's called.
1. The Spanish Comparison

In Spanish, you have two options for many sentences:

    Before: Me puedes entender.

    Attached: Puedes entenderme.

In Spanish, that "sticking it to the end" is called enclisis.
2. The French Rule: The "Pre-Verb" Slot

French does not allow enclisis (attaching to the end) in standard sentences. Even if you have two verbs (like "can" and "understand"), the pronoun stays in front of the infinitive.
English	Spanish (Attached)	French
You can understand me.	Puedes entenderme.	Tu peux **m'**entendre.
I want to see it.	Quiero verlo.	Je veux le voir.
He should tell us.	Él debe decirnos.	Il doit nous dire.
3. The One Exception: The Imperative

There is only one time in French where the pronoun moves to the back (like in Spanish), and that is when you are giving an affirmative command.

    Spanish: ¡Dime! (Tell me!)

    French: Dis-moi !

But as soon as the command is negative, it jumps back to the front:

    French: Ne me dis pas ! (Don't tell me!)

Why is this tricky?

As a Spanish speaker, your brain is used to the pronoun being "part" of the verb at the end. In French, you have to "anticipate" the object before you even say the action.

    Quick Note on "Jolie": To answer your previous question, Jolie means "Pretty" (feminine). While it's a nice compliment, in French, calling an AI "Jolie" is grammatically interesting because you used the feminine form! If you were talking to a man, you’d say Beau.

Would you like to try translating a few "I want to [verb] you" sentences into French to see if you can catch the pronoun placement?

What is the root verb for understand in French


And give me the table for simple plural

The root verb for "understand" in French is Comprendre.

It is an irregular verb, but it follows the same pattern as the verb prendre (to take). If you learn how to conjugate prendre, you automatically know how to conjugate comprendre, apprendre (to learn), and surprendre (to surprise).
Conjugation Table: Present Tense

Since you asked for the plural forms, I have included those below, along with the singular forms for context so you can see how the stem changes.
Subject	French	English
Singular
Je	comprends	I understand
Tu	comprends	You understand (informal)
Il / Elle / On	comprend	He / She / One understands
Plural
Nous	comprenons	We understand
Vous	comprenez	You understand (formal/plural)
Ils / Elles	comprennent	They understand

A Quick Pronunciation Tip

In French, the "d" is silent in the singular forms (comprends/comprend). However, when you move to the plural forms, the "n" sound becomes much more prominent.

In the third-person plural (Ils comprennent), you actually double the "n" in writing, which makes the preceding "e" sound like "short e" (as in "get"), and the final "-ent" is completely silent. It sounds like com-prenn.
Back to your "Pronoun" Question

Remember our previous talk about where to put the "me" or "it"? If you wanted to say "They understand me," you would put the pronoun right before that plural verb:

    Ils me comprennent. (They understand me.)

    Nous vous comprenons. (We understand you.)

Would you like to try a practice sentence using one of these plural forms with a pronoun?
